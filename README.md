# vintage-turbo-pascal

I wrote these codes around 1992 when I was in university and learning Pascal and then C. It is a miracle that still could find them somewhere in my files :beers:.
Some identation needs correction due to copy from DOS to Windows to MAC. Learning Pascal and computer programming was truly a turning point in my life and shaped who I am today.
To memory of my best friend [Prof. Sina Khorasani](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/prof-sina-khorasani-passed-away-baktash-behmanesh/) which tought me programming for the first time.
